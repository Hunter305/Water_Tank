# Water Tank Problem

This project was developed as part of a task given by IoFactory. Below are the details of the input and output for the Water Tank Problem.

## Task Description

Given `n` always greater than -1, representing the block height. Now compute the units of water stored in-between the blocks. Build a Web Application (Frontend Solution) using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS to represent the solution.

## Input and Output Details

The system takes the following inputs: [0,4,0,0,0,6,0,6,4,0]

- **walls of the tank:** the wall units of the water tank.
- **Water source:** water captured inside the wall.

Based on these inputs, the system calculates and displays the following outputs:

- **Current Water Level:** The water unit level.

## Implementation

The implementation details include algorithms for water level prediction, giving visual representation
